# SongMatrix
This webside can show you the repetitiveness of a song using a [Self-similarity matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-similarity_matrix) or a [Dot plot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_plot_(bioinformatics)). The idea of this project came from Colin Morris "Tedx Talk" [Pop Music is Stuck on Repeat](https://youtu.be/_tjFwcmHy5M).
